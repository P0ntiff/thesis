\chapter{Literature Review}

You will need to review previous work in the field, which may include
books and papers (``literature''), patents and commercial products
(``prior art''), and earlier work in your Department.  This
information is usually (but not always) collected in a single chapter,
whose title should preferably be more specific and interesting than
the one above.
