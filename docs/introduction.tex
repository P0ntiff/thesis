\chapter{Introduction}

The introductory chapter describes the importance of the field and the
scope and significance of your project.  It usually ends with an
overview of the remainder of the thesis.

Notice that Arabic page numbering begins with Chapter 1.  Preceding
pages (known as ``frontmatter'') have Roman numbering.  The
\texttt{book} document class in \LaTeX\ follows this numbering
convention by default (see Lamport~\cite{lamport}, p.\,80).
