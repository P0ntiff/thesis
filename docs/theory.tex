\chapter{Theory}

A scientific paper is likely to be read by people who are not
specialists in the same field as the author(s), but who nevertheless
may need to use the results of the paper in their own fields.
Similarly, the examiners of your thesis will probably include at least
one academic who does not teach or conduct research in the subject
area of your thesis.  In an early chapter of your thesis, therefore,
you should quote any theoretical results which are necessary for the
understanding of later chapters.  Examiners who are not specialists in
your area will know whether you have given sufficient theoretical
information.  They will also know whether you have insulted their
status by presenting material which is familiar to every
half-competent graduate in every field of ECE.
