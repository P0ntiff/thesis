%"Invariances in explanation methods give a concrete way to rule out the adequacy of the method for certain tasks. We primarily focused on invariance under model randomization, and label randomization. Many other transformations are worth investigating and can shed light on various methods we did and did not evaluate. Along these lines, we hope that our paper is a stepping stone towards a more rigorous evaluation of new explanation methods, rather than a verdict on existing methods.
