  Dear Professor Abbosh,
\end{flushleft}

In accordance with the requirements of the degree of Bachelor of
Engineering (Honours) in the division of Software Engineering,
I present the following thesis entitled ``Evaluating Feature Attribution Methods''.  
This work was performed under the supervision of Dr Alina Bialkowski.

I declare that the work submitted in this thesis is my own, except as
acknowledged in the text and footnotes, and has not been previously
submitted for a degree at The University of Queensland or any other
institution.

	Yours sincerely,\\
